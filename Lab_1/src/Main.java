//Lab Exercise 1:
//        Implement a class named Person and two subclasses Student and Employee.
//        Employee has Faculty and Staff subclasses. A person has a name, address, phone
//        number and email address. A student has a status (freshman, sophomore, junior or
//        senior). An employee has an office, salary and date hired. Define a class named
//        MyDate that contains the fields year, month, and day. A faculty member has office
//        hours and a rank. A staff member has a title. Override the toString method in each
//        class to display the class name and personâ€™s name. Make FullTime and PartTime
//        subclasses of staff. Full-time staff have a fixed salary whereas part time staff has
//        salary depending on worked hour. Implement this requirement that demonstrate the
//        earning of both staffs
